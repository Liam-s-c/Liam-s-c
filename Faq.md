#### FAQ:
* Q1, Why do you like to use Python more than other programming languages, even if it makes the project harder and more difficult to complete?
* A1, If I had to be completely honest: It's mainly because I'm used to it. 
It wasnt the first language I was learning that badge goes to Java, since I used to make minecraft mods

* Q2, How long have you been programming?
* A2, Almost 6 years (did you even read the above sections?)

* Q3, When will you upload **ALL** of your code?
* A3, Sometime before the end of august 2021, I need to re-comment and write README.md files for all of my past projects and code, so that's why it's taking forever...

* Q4, What is your current project?
* A4, I usually am working on multiple projects at a time. At the time of writing this i am planning a project which is a notification feed of sorts, that collects all the data and notifications from a bunch of different media, Discord, Emails, texts, the time, the latest news, weather, my todo, my calender ... etc. To put on a vertical monitor on my wall, also will be an application that i can easiy manipulate to run on a rasberry pi touch 7in

* Q5, Why did you first want to code?
* A5, I started wanting to code when I learnt about modded minecraft, I started using mods on minecraft that were made by other people, and this was when i learnt about one of the programming princables that i live by, which states "You shouldn't have to / need to rely on other programmers code" if another programmers code is faulty or doesn't have the features that you want, you shouldn't need to rely on it, AKA. if another persons code isnt want you want, make it yourself. So that's what i live by, if a project has already been done, what can i do to make it better or make it so its more specific to something i need, and in minecraft i wanted a feature, and this mod i was using didnt have it but should have so i made it myself, that project took about 2 and a half months to complete

* Q6, How are you answering questions if no one had asked you any of these before?
* A6, FAQ in this case doesnt stand for Frequently Asked Questions it stands for Fully Anticipated Questions
